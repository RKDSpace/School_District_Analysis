# Overview of the school district analysis
Maria has discovered possible academic dishonestly in the initial analysis run with the ninth-grade math and reading scores at Thomas High School. Due to the possible academic dishonesty, she has requested the analysis to be run again with entering NaN results for the ninth grade reading and math scores. The below formula was used to set the scores to NaN:

# Results
Once we have reset the ninth-grade scores, the full analysis was run on the dataset that was run in the initial analysis (module work). 
•	The district summary was affected by the totals changing to Nan results by the scores increasing in Thoms High School. The below analysis shows the new scores based on the new student counts when the ninth grade results are removed.

 The overall changes to the district are reflected below:

The school summary was affected by reflecting that the math and reading scores have increased. With replacing the ninth-grade scores as Nan, when we look at the student scores for Thomas High School grades 10-12, we see that the result is 93%. Which is an increase from the initial analysis.

Replacing the ninth grader’s math and reading scores not only affected the Thomas High School results among 10-12 it also improved the school standings performance relative to the other schools. Thomas High School went from being one of the lower performing schools to the second highest performing school relative to grades:

The math and reading scores by grade levels looked more accurate overall when ninth grade scores were replaced. The breakdown of the math and reading scores by grade is broken down as follows:

The analysis was further done to look at how school spending was affected per student. Spending fell in the higher end buckets at $601-$650 per student. This is the second highest spending bucket.

When looking at scores by school size Thomas High School was affected as they were one of the smaller schools in the district:

# Summary: 
The overall analysis has reflected that with the ninth-grade scores replaced with NaNs Thomas High Schools overall performance improved. As a charter school, compared with other charter schools the analysis was not complete at this point.
